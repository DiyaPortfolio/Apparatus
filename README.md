Apparatus is a performance focused and efficient math library with a C++ backend. The library specializes in linear algebra, number theory, and basic arithmetic. A coming feature will allow to use the JNI, so that the library can give you the C++ performance speeds in other languages.

An example use case of declaring a vector using Apparatus:
```cpp
// Declare a vector of type double and length 3
Vector<double, 3> vec1{1, 2, 3};
```

Another strong use case that this language gives you is access to a wide variety of sorting algorithms.
